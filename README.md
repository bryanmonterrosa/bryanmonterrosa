- ðŸ’» My programming language experience include Java and TypeScript, and I have hands-on experience with Spring Boot and Angular through personal practice projects.

- ðŸŽ¯ My career goal is to become a Java Back End Developer, and I pride myself on being a fast learner who has made significant progress in recent months.
